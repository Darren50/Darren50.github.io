                        <center>This is a project that I have done during my 5-month internship at DSTA.</center>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Project Summary:</b>
                        DSTA required a
                        consolidated 3D model repository platform to allow 3D models to be hosted, shared and interacted
                        with in order
                        with in order to improve the productivity of the organisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the start, this project definitely seemed stressful for someone who hasn't done web
                        development before. Having to decide how to store, display, share the 3D models and more.
                        Features like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>User Authentication</li>
                        <li>Augmented Reality (AR) view</li>
                        <li>File conversion</li>
                    </ul>
                    and more were some of the must-haves for the project to succeed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin, I decided to find the best modules, libraries and languages to use for the project. I
                        stumbled upon <b>modelviewer.dev</b>, a module created by Google that allows displaying of 3D
                        models
                        of .glTF and .GLB format on the web using WebGL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/mvdPic.PNG" class="center" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This library was absolutely amazing as it allowed me to easily display the models without having
                        to interfere much with <b>Three.js</b> which will take more time to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <model-viewer src="models/village.glb" class="card-img-top center"
                            style="width:500px;height:500px;" shadow-intensity="1" camera-controls touch-action="pan-y">
                        </model-viewer>
                    </p>
                    <p>I then tinkered with <b>PHP</b> and <b>XAMPP</b> and quickly learnt the basics of them and
                        created a simple web app with the core features like downloading, uploading and displaying the
                        models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/3DAMprototype.PNG" class="center" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>Afterwards, I had to work on creating a 3D file converter. This was honestly the most difficult
                        part
                        of the entire project as there were hardly any resources on it. Furthermore, the format that
                        DSTA
                        uses was OpenFlight (.FLT), which was unconventional and old. I scoured through the internet
                        throughly and could only find 1 software that can do something like this for free.
                        The software was <b>ModelConverterX</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/MCX.PNG" class="center" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>Learning to implement the converting software on the web was easier due to the kind users from
                        the
                        forums
                        which assisted me.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, I wished that that was it for the file conversion process but no. You see, the thing is MCX
                        only converted OpenFlight files to .OBJ files. The .glTF output didn't work as well as it is
                        separated to multiple files which is not supported by ModelViewerDev. So what I did was to
                        use the Blender as a Python module to finalise the conversion. So the final conversion process
                        looks like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/fileConversionProcess.PNG" class="center" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had to then find a web framework to move my project to. As much as it was possible to use raw
                        PHP to do everything, a web framework would have many out of the box tools like user
                        authentication which would be a pain to do with PHP alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I was already using PHP, I chose <b>Laravel</b> as my web framework. It's one of the most
                        popular web frameworks and I found it simple to use. I migrated my code to the Laravel framework
                        and implemented features like an admin panel, the user authentication and some minor stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I implemented other features along the way such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zipped file download of multiple models</li>
                        <li>Augmented Reality (AR) view</li>
                        <p>
                            <img src="images/ARview.png" class="center" alt="" style="height:40vh; width:20vh">
                        </p>
                        <li>PDF download of list of models</li>
                        <li>User access rights (where users can only view models of their level)</li>
                        <li>KML File download</li>
                        <li>Cart system</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made use of virtual machines to deploy the web application. One VM will be the 'storage' VM
                        and the other will be the one hosting the web app. This is done so that it is easier to scale
                        the technical requirements like storage space or processing speed. The final deployment
                        architecture is seen below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/finalDeploymentACT.PNG" class="center" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>As much as I want to describe more about my internship experience, it would probably take hours
                        to do so. To finalise my thoughts about this project, was this the most well done project? No.
                        Was this project coded the best way possible? No. Did I learn a lot however? Definitely. I can
                        safely say that this internship experience introduced me to not only technical skills like web
                        development, but also things like self-directed learning which will benefit me more as I
                        continue my journey to be a better programmer. </p>
